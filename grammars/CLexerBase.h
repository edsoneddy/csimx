/// CLexerBase — vendored from antlr/grammars-v4/c, patched for csimx.
///
/// Integrates preprocessing into the lexer: the constructor accepts the
/// original (un-preprocessed) CharStream and transparently replaces it
/// with a preprocessed version before any token is produced.
///
/// Preprocessing modes (configured via setArgs() before construction):
///   (default)  — skip preprocessing (pass-through)
///   --nopp     — skip preprocessing (pass-through), same as default
///   --gcc      — gcc -std=c2x -E -C
///   --clang    — clang -std=c2x -E -C
///
/// Additional options forwarded to the preprocessor:
///   --Dname=value   → -Dname=value
///   --Ipath         → -Ipath
///
/// csimx-specific change from upstream: the default was originally --gcc
/// (shell out to a real `gcc` via popen() on every parse). csimx can't assume
/// gcc/clang is on PATH in a production container, and judge-submission .c
/// files won't have consistent include paths anyway -- real preprocessing
/// was never going to work here. Defaulting to --nopp instead means csimx
/// gets correct behavior without every call site needing to remember to opt
/// out; the grammar's `Directive` lexer rule already swallows `#include`/
/// `#define`/etc. lines as hidden tokens even unexpanded, so unpreprocessed
/// source still parses (see csimx/c/utils.py and CHANGELOG.md for the
/// tradeoffs this implies). --gcc/--clang remain available via setArgs() for
/// anyone who explicitly wants real preprocessing.

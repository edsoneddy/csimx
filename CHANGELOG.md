# Changelog

Notable releases. Earlier entries were reconstructed from the commit history,
so they summarise each line rather than list every change.

Note: "dataset F" in the 3.4.2 to 4.0.1 entries is the *first* F (Faidhi ladders, since retired);
the current F of the scsc repository is a different dataset, see `docs/pruning_fidelity.md`.

## [0.2.0] - csimx

The structural stage is no longer identical to csim 4.1.0: weighted hashes, canonical operator forms
and a few config changes reach the other languages (see below), so **scores change** for `java_20`,
`java_24`, `cpp_14`, `c` and `kotlin` (`python_3`, `python_3_13` keep the scores of 0.1.0). The
lexical stage was checked on all seven languages, and the tuning skills moved into the repo.

### Pruning sweep of all seven languages (fidelity-scored), three small config changes

`.claude/skills/csimx-batch-tuner/scripts/fidelity_sweep.py` measures every unclassified token and
rule that occurs in a sample (and the removal of every existing entry) against the near-raw tree:
tree size, MAE of the index and false similarity of cross-problem pairs (8 problems x 8 files per
sample, seed 7). Recommendations were then combined greedily and **validated on two samples not used
to choose (seeds 23 and 11)**; only changes that held on both were applied:

| language | change | MAE (s23 / s11) | nodes | clones >= 0.7 | cross mean |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| java_24 | `FOR`, `WHILE` no longer excluded; `typeTypeOrVoid` excluded | -.0048 / -.0064 | +2.4..+3.6% | 34 -> 35 | .209 -> .205 |
| cpp_14 | `PlusPlus` no longer excluded; `expressionList` no longer collapsed | -.0033 / -.0063 | 0% | 35 -> 35 | .186 -> .175 |
| kotlin | `IF`, `ELSE`, `FUN` excluded | -.0056 / -.0044 | -13% | 34 -> 34 | .393 -> .368 |

Nothing to change in `c` (all 27 candidates rejected; the ones that prune structure raise the MAE by
up to 0.24 and create up to 46 false cross-problem pairs). **Not applied** because they improved the
chosen sample but not the held-out ones: `java_20` (`methodModifier`, `forUpdate` exclusions: MAE
+.0035 / +.0050), `python_3` (`else_clause` collapse, `IF`/`ELSE` tokens: +.0063 / -.0005) and
`python_3_13` (`named_expression`, `LPAR`/`RPAR`, `else_block`: +.0182 / +.0033). Kotlin's corpus has
only 12 problems, so its held-out seeds are not independent. Scores change slightly for these three
languages.

Tooling: the three tuning skills now live in the repo (`.claude/skills/csimx-*`), cover all seven
languages and share `scripts/langs.py`. An older measurement detail was corrected on the way:
`Visitors.py` binds `COLLAPSED_RULE_INDICES` when it is imported, so the near-raw reference of the
earlier tables (`docs/pruning_fidelity.md`, csimx 0.1.0 section) still collapsed `package`/`import`/
array initializers; the sweep empties the sets in place. The comparisons between configs in those
tables are unaffected (same reference for all of them); absolute MAE values are slightly low.

### Lexical stage: checked on all seven languages, two fixes

The lexical stage and `group --prefilter` were checked on `python_3`, `python_3_13`, `java_20`,
`java_24`, `cpp_14`, `c` and `kotlin` (tokenizing ~29000 real files without errors, clones vs.
unrelated pairs, 1440 same-problem pairs per language, `group` with and without the filter through
the CLI). With margin 0.05 and threshold 0.7 the filter lost no pair that the structural stage
flags, except 1 of 238 in `python_3_13` (structural 0.71, lexical 0.63; margin 0.10 loses none);
the groups were identical in every language. The default margin is unchanged.

* Fixed: keyword subtypes (`Keyword.Type`, `Keyword.Declaration`, `Operator.Word`, ...) were
  generalized to one id instead of being kept as written, so `int` equalled `double` and `and`
  equalled `or`, against what is documented above. The effect on the measured pairs is cosmetic.
* Fixed: a file that cannot be read as UTF-8 is now skipped by `group` / `report` (with the message
  `read_file` already printed) instead of failing later, and later with a worse message under
  `--prefilter`.
* New tests for the stage in all seven languages; the wheel smoke test in CI now checks all seven.

### Canonical operator forms for Java, C++, C and Kotlin

The pass that `python_3` got in csim 4.1.0 now exists for `java_20`, `java_24`, `cpp_14`, `c` and
`kotlin` (`CANONICAL_FORMS` in each `utils.py`, rules in `csimx/canonical_common.py` and a small
`canonical.py` per language that only declares which grammar rules and tokens it applies to). It
unifies `a + b` / `b + a`, `*`, `==`, `!=` (operand order), `a > b` / `b < a`, `a >= b` / `b <= a`
and the operand order of `&&`, `||` and the bitwise operators whose token is not in the tree. Like
the Python version it uses tree shape and token types only. `java_24` folds every operator into one
`expression` rule and excludes `<`, `>`, `&&`, `||`, so there only `+`, `*`, `==`, `!=` and `>=`
are unified. Not done (as in `python_3`): negation / De Morgan, `else { if }`, and inlining.

Measured: rewritten pairs (`a + b * c` vs `c * b + a`, `>=` vs `<=`, `a > b + 1` vs `1 + b < a`)
go from 0.94-0.97 to 1.00. The fidelity of the pruning does not move (MAE vs the near-raw tree, seeds
7 / 11 / 23): java_20 .047 / .051 / .045 (same), java_24 .077 / .071 / .065 (same), cpp_14 .056 / .051 / .064 (+.001), c .070 / .078 /
.078 (same), kotlin .054 (same); controlled clones and cross-problem false similarity are unchanged
in every language. `CANONICAL_FORMS = False` restores the previous scores. Scores can change for
programs that use these constructs.

### Weighted hashes for `java_20`, `cpp_14`, `c` and `kotlin`

The weighted hashes that `python_3` got in csim 3.4.2 (a hashed node keeps the mass of the subtree it
replaced, `(size + 1) ** HASH_MASS_ALPHA`, and substitutions between hashed nodes of the same rule are
charged by label overlap) are now on for four more languages, with `HASH_MASS_ALPHA` chosen per
language. Tree size and edit-distance time are unchanged. Mean absolute error of the index vs. the
near-raw tree (3 sets of 12 problems, seeds 7 / 11 / 23, 23 not used to choose):

| language | alpha | MAE before | MAE now | controlled clones >= 0.7 | cross-problem >= 0.7 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| java_20 | 0.4 | .075 / .067 / .063 | .047 / .051 / .045 | 34 -> 34 | 0 -> 0 of 150 |
| cpp_14 | 0.6 | .080 / .087 / .089 | .056 / .051 / .063 | 34 -> 35 | 0 -> 0 of 150 |
| c | 0.6 | .123 / .110 / .115 | .070 / .078 / .078 | 28 -> 33 | 0 -> 0 of 150 |
| kotlin (synthetic) | 0.6 | .083 | .054 | 35 -> 34 | 15 -> 8 of 150 |

`java_24` is left unweighted: alpha 0.25-0.6 moves the MAE by -0.007..+0.010 and adds a bias of -0.03 to
-0.07. Kotlin's corpus has only 12 problems, so all three seeds select the same set and there is no
held-out check; read its numbers as indicative. Scores change for these languages.

## [0.1.0] - csimx

csimx is a fork of csim 4.1.0 (the structural stage, trees and index, is unchanged and gives the
same scores) with a second, lexical stage. Everything below this entry is the history of csim,
written when the project was still called csim.

### Lexical prefilter for `group` (opt-in)

The lexical stage (`csimx/lexical/`) compares the token sequences of two files: Pygments tokens
with comments and blanks dropped and every name, number and string generalized to its type
(keywords, operators and punctuation kept as written), and the Myers (1986) O(ND) distance,
`1 - d / (len_a + len_b)`. It works for the seven supported languages and never produces a
reported index.

With `--prefilter` (or `--prefilter-margin X`, which also turns it on) `group` runs the lexical
stage on every pair first and only compares structurally the pairs whose lexical index reaches
`threshold - margin` (never below 0). A file that takes part in no such pair is not parsed. Two
exits make the lexical stage cheap on the pairs it discards: a bound from the lengths (the best
index two sequences of those lengths can have) and Myers stopped at the largest distance that
still reaches the minimum. Without either option every pair is compared structurally.

* `--prefilter`: margin 0.05 (`PREFILTER_MARGIN`); `--prefilter-margin X`: margin X, from 0.0 to
  0.30 (`MAX_PREFILTER_MARGIN`; above that the minimum falls under 0.4 at the usual threshold
  0.7 and almost no pair is skipped). Only valid for `group`. A line on stderr says how many
  pairs were skipped and how many files were parsed.
* `group_by_exhaustive_search(..., prefilter_margin=None, stats=None)`; `csimx.Tokenize`,
  `LexicalDistance`, `LexicalIndex`, `LexicalAtLeast`.
* New dependency: `pygments>=2.20,<3`.

**It is a lossy filter.** The lexical index is not an upper bound of the structural one: two
files can have the same structure and quite different tokens (a moved block, reordered
statements). Measured with csim 4.1.0's structural stage on the pairs of the scsc datasets A-F
(4673 pairs, tokens of the raw text): pairs flagged above the group threshold `t` that the
filter would have discarded, out of those flagged:

| margin | t=0.5 | t=0.6 | t=0.7 | t=0.8 | t=0.9 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.00 | 3/681 | 2/647 | 1/605 | 1/540 | 7/476 |
| 0.05 | 3/681 | 2/647 | 1/605 | 0/540 | 2/476 |
| 0.10 | 3/681 | 2/647 | 1/605 | 0/540 | 0/476 |

and the share of all pairs it discards, with margin 0.05: 14% at t=0.5, 68% at t=0.6, 85% at
t=0.7, 86% at t=0.8, 87% at t=0.9. At t=0.7 the one pair lost is a pair labelled not similar
(B `submission99.py` / `submission100.py`, structural 0.73, lexical 0.22). `group` on A (63 files),
F (60) and B (174) with t=0.7 gave the same groups in 3.4x, 4.6x and 4.2x less time with a lexical
minimum of 0.6 (margin 0.1; measured with the inlining pass of a csim branch that this fork does
not include, so the times are indicative). It pays off from `t` about 0.6 up. These numbers were
measured on the datasets used to choose the margin, not on an unseen set: treat 0.05 as a
starting point.

# Changelog of csim (inherited)

## [4.1.0]

### Canonical forms for equivalent constructs (`python_3` only)

Equivalent ways of writing the same thing now produce the same tree, so they get
the same hashes and cost nothing in the edit distance. It is a pass over the
normalized tree (`csim/python_3/canonical.py`, switched with
`python_3/utils.py: CANONICAL_FORMS`) that runs before pruning and hashing:

* comparison orientation: `a > b` = `b < a`, `a >= b` = `b <= a`; `==` and `!=`
  get their operands in a fixed order;
* negation: `not (a < b)` = `a >= b` (and the other pairs, plus `in` / `not in`
  and `is` / `is not`), `not not x` = `x`, and De Morgan, `not (a and b)` =
  `not a or not b` (`and` / `or` are not in the tree, so only the shape moves);
* commutative operands: the two sides of `and` / `or` and of `*`, `+`, `&`, `|`,
  `^`;
* `else: if ...` = `elif ...`.

Chained comparisons (`a < b < c`) are not touched. Every rule uses the shape of
the tree and token types only (native terminals carry no text), so nothing
compares identifiers. Other languages, and `python_3_13`, are unchanged.

What it does, measured (details in `docs/pruning_fidelity.md`):

* 190 real programs rewritten with three or more of these equivalences at once:
  mean similarity to the original 0.922 -> 0.968, identical trees 0% -> 66%.
  Pairs under 0.70 barely move (2.1% -> 1.6%): csim already held those.
* Datasets A-E (csim at 0.70): F1 and AUC unchanged within 0.004 (D F1
  0.933 -> 0.937, E AUC 0.9584 -> 0.9572); 500 cross-problem pairs of `all_py`:
  0 above 0.70 before and after; controlled clones 34/36 before and after.

Scores can change slightly for programs that contain these constructs, so this is
a minor version, not a patch. `CANONICAL_FORMS = False` restores 4.0.1 exactly.

## [4.0.1]

### `legacy` is the default index again

4.0.0 made `ratio` (`max / (max + d)`) the default similarity index. That was
reverted: `ratio` and `legacy` (`1 - d / max`) rank pairs identically, so the
gains seen at a fixed 0.70 cut (dataset F macro F1 0.686 -> 0.824) come from
moving the scale, not from separating related and unrelated pairs better, and
the scale had been chosen while looking at the same datasets used to evaluate
it. Keeping it as the default would bake that choice into every consumer.

`--index` / `index_formula=` stay, so `ratio` and `metric` remain available for
sensitivity analyses. With `legacy` as the default, scores and thresholds are
exactly those of csim 3.4.2: consumers pinned to 4.0.0 should move to 4.0.1
and, if they translated thresholds to the `ratio` scale, translate them back
(`t_legacy = 2 - 1 / t_ratio`). 4.0.0 is the only release whose default differs.

## [4.0.0]

### Selectable similarity index, with a new default (**breaking**; default reverted in 4.0.1)

`SimilarityIndex` was `1 - d / max(n1, n2)`, with a fallback to
`1 - d / (n1 + n2)` whenever `d` passed the bound `max(n1, n2)` does not
actually impose. The formula is now selectable with `--index` / `-ix` on the
CLI and `index_formula=` on `Compare`, `report_pairwise_similarity`,
`group_by_exhaustive_search` and `SimilarityIndex`:

| Value | Formula |
|---|---|
| `ratio` (new default) | `max / (max + d)` |
| `metric` | `(n1 + n2 - d) / (n1 + n2 + d)` |
| `legacy` | `1 - d / max`, the index of csim <= 3.4.2 |

This is language-independent: it changes only the normalization step, not any
grammar, normalization or pruning configuration.

**Every score changes.** Consumers that do not pass `index_formula` get the
new scale, so pinned thresholds must be re-derived. `ratio` is a *monotone
rescaling* of `legacy` -- both rank pairs identically, and their ROC/AUC are
the same to the last digit on all six scsc datasets -- so a `legacy` threshold
translates exactly as `t_ratio = 1 / (2 - t_legacy)`: 0.70 -> 0.769,
0.80 -> 0.833, 0.90 -> 0.909. Note also that `ratio` does not reach 0 in
practice: a pair with nothing in common sits near 0.5.

**Why change the default.** `legacy`'s denominator does not bound `d`, so its
scale has a discontinuity where it swaps denominators (measured: that branch
fires once in 6642 real pairs). `ratio` removes it, stays in (0, 1] by
construction, and places a fixed cut of 0.70 at a usable operating point: on
the scsc datasets, macro F1 at 0.70 goes 0.847 -> 0.867, dataset F goes 0.686
-> 0.824, and the controlled clone set goes from 34/36 to 36/36 above 0.70,
with cross-problem false similarity still 0/750.

To be explicit about what this is: since `ratio` and `legacy` rank pairs
identically, those gains are **recalibration, not better discrimination**. The
threshold-free AUC is unchanged. `metric` is the one option that ranks
differently (it normalizes by total size); it is included because it is a
published metric normalization of tree edit distance and makes the ablation
citable.

## [3.4.2]

### Weighted hashes for `python_3` (partial credit inside hashed subtrees)

A hashed node used to cost 1 whatever it replaced, and two hashed nodes of the
same rule with different content cost a flat 0.5. Now, for `python_3` only, a
hashed node keeps the *mass* of the subtree it replaced (`(size + 1) ** 0.6`,
`HASH_MASS_ALPHA` in `python_3/utils.py`) and the multiset of labels it
covered. Insert/delete cost the weight, and a substitution between two hashed
nodes of the same rule costs `weight * (1 - overlap)` (never below 0.5), so a
statement that changed by one call is charged a fraction of a statement that
was replaced entirely. Tree size, and so edit-distance time, is unchanged.

* Fidelity (mean |error| of the index vs. the near-raw tree, 3 sets of 12
  `all_py` problems, seeds 7/11 used to choose, 23 held out): 0.087 / 0.098 /
  0.098 -> 0.052 / 0.061 / 0.054, bias ~0.
* No new false similarity: 0/250 cross-problem pairs >= 0.7 per set (as before).
* Dataset F (Faidhi ladder, 90 related + 60 unrelated pairs): AUC at L6 goes
  0.916 -> 0.950; recall at threshold 0.70 is essentially unchanged
  (L4 14/18, L5 16 -> 15/27, L6 9/36). See `docs/pruning_fidelity.md`.
* `jv-umsa-dataset/controlled`: 35 -> 34 of 36 pairs >= 0.7 (one pair moved
  0.70 -> 0.67).
* `PruneAndHash` now returns the tree *mass* as its second value for weighted
  languages (what `SimilarityIndex` needs); `count_nodes` and `csim tree` still
  report real node counts. `--talg zss` supports the weights too.
* Other languages, `python_3_13` included, are unchanged.

## [3.4.1]

### New: `csim.count_nodes`

`count_nodes(file_name, file_content, lang)` returns `(nodes_before, nodes_after)`: the size
of the raw ANTLR parse tree and of the normalized, pruned and hashed tree that is given to
the tree edit distance (the number `csim tree` prints as "Total nodes after pruning"). It
works for every language, with the native and the pure-Python parsers. No other change since
3.4.0.

## [3.4.0]

### Less aggressive pruning for `python_3` and `python_3_13`

Compound statements (`if`/`while`/`for`/`with`/`def`/`class`) are no longer
hashed, and `try/except/finally`, `elif`/`else` (and `raise`/`assert`/
`with_item` in `python_3_13`) are no longer excluded. Previously a program
that was a single loop became one node (median compression ~30x). Measured on
3 disjoint sets of 12 real `all_py` problems, the mean error of the similarity
index vs. the unpruned tree drops from ~0.14-0.18 to ~0.08-0.09 at ~6-7x
compression. Method and numbers: `docs/pruning_fidelity.md`.

### Same policy for Java 20/24, C++14, C and Kotlin

Only expression/declaration "islands" are hashed now (new optional
`STRUCTURAL_RULE_INDICES` in each language's `utils.py`: a hashed rule that
contains control flow, e.g. a lambda with a block body, is not collapsed).
Previously Java 20 collapsed 93% of real files to a single node, java_24 and
cpp_14 to a median of 8 and 3 nodes, and those configs scored 34-40% of
*unrelated* submission pairs as >= 0.7 similar (0% on the unpruned tree). Now:
mean index error vs. the unpruned tree 0.06-0.12 at 5.5-9.5x compression and
0-0.2% false similarity. Assignments, `if`/`for`/`switch`/`throw`/`catch`,
declarations and types are no longer dropped wholesale. New: `for`/`while`
equivalence (`LOOP`) in every language; `x op= y` == `x = x op y` in every
language (also on the native path); modifier rules excluded in java_24;
built-in type keywords excluded in C/C++. Full table: `docs/pruning_fidelity.md`.
`csim tree` now prints readable names for synthetic ids (`if_stmt`, ...).

### Fixed: augmented assignment normalization (`x += y` vs `x = x + y`)

The rewrite in `python_3_13` built a tree of a different shape than the
naturally-parsed `x = x + y` (one child instead of two, and the reused target
kept the target rule instead of the expression rule), so the two never hashed
equal. It now re-emits the target as its right-hand-side twin (`atom`, or the
`primary` chain for `a[i]` / `self.x`) and adds the `star_targets` child.
`python_3` had no rewrite at all; it now gets the same one (done in `visit()`,
so the native parser path sees it too). Covered for all 13 operators plus
subscript/attribute targets in regression tests.

### Fixed: `python_3` lexer crash on trailing whitespace at EOF

`Python3LexerBase.HandleSpaces` called `chr(-1)` when a file ended in spaces
(`ValueError: chr() arg not in range`), making `Compare` return `None`. Fixed in
the Python lexer base and in `grammars/Python3LexerBase.cpp` (the C++ change
needs a native rebuild to take effect).

### Restored: `for` / `while` equivalence (as in 2.0.0)

Both loop kinds share the `LOOP` label again (`CONTROL_EQUIVALENCE_RULE_INDICES`),
and the loop variable / `for`/`while`/`in` keywords no longer add a node. On
the hand-made clone set (`jv-umsa-dataset/controlled`, 36 all-vs-all pairs, all clones)
36 -> 35 (`python_3`) and 34 (`python_3_13`) pairs score >= 0.7, 2.0.0: 34.
`python_3` also drops the `def`/`class` keywords and hashes `def_parameters`,
as `python_3_13` already did. Trade-off: `for` vs `while` no longer costs a
full mismatch.

## [3.3.0]

### New language: C (experimental, grammars-v4/c)

Added C as a fully new language to csim (ISO C23 grammar + GNU/MSVC
extensions), the same shape of addition as Kotlin above: a pure-Python
parser (`csim/c/`), a native C++ parser backed by a real symbol-table
implementation for typedef disambiguation, and the full
Normalize/PruneAndHash pipeline (`csim/c/utils.py`).

**Performance** (single cold pass, one process, 70-file synthetic
judge-style corpus, plus a 25-file adversarial real-world sample from
grammars-v4's own c-testsuite -- no C corpus in `jv_dataset` to use directly):

| Corpus | Pure Python | Native C++ | Speedup |
|---|---|---|---|
| Synthetic (70 files) | 3.958 ms/file | 0.539 ms/file | ~7.3x |
| c-testsuite sample (25 files) | 9.565 ms/file | 1.650 ms/file | ~5.8x |

**Correctness**: 32/32 grammars-v4 example files and 70/70 synthetic corpus
files parse clean; 22/25 on the adversarial c-testsuite sample (the 3
failures are macro-token-pasting tricks and a GNU array-range initializer
outside this grammar's coverage -- see below). Native and pure-Python
parsers verified byte-identical at every pipeline stage via
`test/test_native_parsers.py`.

**Two upstream issues patched before shipping** (found during the earlier
spike, see project history):
1. The vendored `CLexerBase`/`CParserBase` (both C++ and Python target)
   defaulted to shelling out to a real `gcc`/invoking `subprocess` on every
   parse, and the **Python** target read `sys.argv` directly to decide this
   -- inside csim, `sys.argv` holds csim's own CLI arguments, not anything
   related to C preprocessing. Patched to default to `--nopp` (skip
   preprocessing) and to read an explicit, csim-controlled args list
   instead of `sys.argv`. A production container can't assume gcc/clang is
   on PATH, and judge submissions have no consistent include paths anyway.
2. Both targets unconditionally wrote the source text to a `<name>.p` file
   on disk on every single parse call, even in the (now-default) pass-through
   case. Removed -- wasted I/O per file and a race condition under
   concurrent use, for a debug artifact csim has no use for.

**Known limitations**: with preprocessing disabled, `#include`/`#define`/
etc. lines are swallowed as hidden tokens rather than expanded (the grammar
has a generic `Directive` rule for this), which means macro-dependent code
(token-pasting tricks, macros used for control flow) can fail to parse or
parse differently than a real compiler would see it. Real judge submissions
essentially never rely on that. Like Kotlin, there is no real-world C corpus
in this project's benchmark set to tune `csim/c/utils.py`'s normalization
rules against yet -- treat `group`/`report` results as a reasonable starting
point, not a tuned config.

**Usage**:
- `--lang c` for `report`/`group`/`tree`
- `csim info` reports native parser availability
- `CSIM_DISABLE_NATIVE=1` forces the pure-Python parser

---

### Fix: wrong terminal text in `csim tree --show-raw` for all native languages

`csim/native/loader.py`'s `_literal_names()` read the generated Lexer class's
own `literalNames` list to give native-parsed terminals their source text.
That list turned out to be populated in literal-declaration order, not
indexed by token type -- e.g. `CPP14Lexer.literalNames[CPP14Lexer.LeftParen]`
was `"'/'"`, not `"'('"` (ANTLR's own runtime indexes it the same naive way,
so this is an upstream code-generation quirk affecting every native language
already shipped: `java_20`, `java_24`, `cpp_14`, `python_3`). Discovered while
adding Kotlin, whose keywords showed up as unrelated words (`FUN` displayed
as `'super'`) under `--show-raw`.

**Did not affect correctness of `report`/`group`/similarity scoring** --
those never read terminal text, only `token.type` (see
`csim/processing/tree_processing.py`) -- only the cosmetic `--show-raw` tree
dump was wrong, which nothing in the test suite previously exercised.

Fixed by sourcing literal text from the generated `.tokens` file instead
(`'<literal>'=<type>` lines), which is correctly keyed by token type. Added
`test_native_terminal_text_matches_python_when_present` to
`test/test_native_parsers.py`, parametrized across all native languages, to
catch a regression here in the future.

### New language: Kotlin (experimental, grammars-v4/kotlin/kotlin)

Added Kotlin as a fully new language to csim -- a pure-Python parser
(`csim/kotlin/`), a native C++ parser, and the full Normalize/PruneAndHash
pipeline (`csim/kotlin/utils.py`), unlike the `java_24`/`python_3` additions
in 3.2.0 which only added a native accelerator next to an *already-existing*
pure-Python parser. No custom lexer/parser base class was needed for either
target: this grammar declares no `superClass` at all -- Kotlin's string
template interpolation is handled entirely through native ANTLR lexer modes.

**Performance** (single cold pass, one process, 70-file synthetic
judge-style corpus -- see below for why synthetic):

| Parser | Avg/file |
|---|---|
| Pure Python (ANTLR Python3 target) | 148.14 ms |
| Native C++ (ANTLR Cpp target) | 16.69 ms |

**~8.9x speedup.**

**Correctness**: native and pure-Python parsers verified byte-identical at
every pipeline stage (raw tree, `Normalize`, `PruneAndHash`, similarity
scores, `group`/`report` CLI output) via `test/test_native_parsers.py`.

**Known limitation -- untuned grouping precision:** unlike every other
language in csim, there is no real-world Kotlin corpus in this project's
benchmark set (`jv_dataset` has Java/C++/Python submissions only) to tune or
validate `csim/kotlin/utils.py`'s normalization rules against. The rules
follow the same *categories* already validated for other languages
(structural punctuation excluded, identifier text excluded, import/package
plumbing collapsed, function/class/property bodies hashed for tree-edit-
distance tractability) but have not been corpus-measured for false-positive/
false-negative rates the way `java_24`'s `SYNTHETIC_ASSIGNMENT_EXPR` fix or
`python_3`'s `relabel_node()` fixes were. Treat `group`/`report` results on
Kotlin as a reasonable starting point, not a tuned config, until a real
corpus is available to drive the next pass.

**Usage**:
- `--lang kotlin` for `report`/`group`/`tree`
- `csim info` reports native parser availability
- `CSIM_DISABLE_NATIVE=1` forces the pure-Python parser

## [3.2.0]

### New: Python 3 native parser (grammars-v4/python/python)

Added a native C++ parser for Python using grammars-v4's "universal Python
2/3" grammar, available alongside the existing `python_3_13` parser (nothing
about `python_3_13` was removed or changed). Unlike `java_24` below, grouping
output has been tuned to match the pure-Python parser closely, not just
parsing speed.

**Performance** (`csim group` end-to-end, real files, `jv_dataset/all_py`):

| Corpus | `python_3_13` | Native `python_3` | Speedup |
|--------|---------------|--------------------|---------|
| 67 files | 0.92s | 0.25s | 3.7x |
| 296 files | 4.10s | 2.15s | 1.9x |

Underlying parse-only speedup is 18.65x; the smaller end-to-end numbers
reflect tree-edit-distance cost, which now dominates once parsing is fast
(profiled: parsing is 91.6% of `python_3_13`'s runtime, 18% of `python_3`'s).

**Grouping correctness:** validated by comparing `csim group`'s output against
`python_3_13` pairwise, threshold 0.8, on multiple real corpora:

| Corpus | Threshold-crossing pairs | Result |
|--------|--------------------------|--------|
| `all_py/1050` (67 files, 2211 pairs) | 0 | `csim group` output byte-identical |
| `all_py/1006` (296 files) | 0 | `csim group` output byte-identical |
| `all_py/1039` (91 files) | 26 | known limitation, see below |

Three root causes were found and fixed via `csim/python_3/utils.py`'s
`relabel_node()` hook (same engine-level technique introduced for `java_24`):
import statements collapsed to a content-free marker (matching
`python_3_13`), `try`/`except`/`finally` excluded entirely (matching
`python_3_13`), and each `compound_stmt` alternative (`if`/`while`/`for`/
`with`/`class`/`def`) given its own synthetic rule id so a control-flow-kind
change costs full similarity distance instead of the partial credit a shared
rule index would give.

**Known limitation:** on files with very few top-level statements,
`python_3`'s tree can end up smaller/coarser than `python_3_13`'s for the
same source, which can slightly overstate similarity (a boilerplate match
counts for proportionally more of a smaller tree). Root cause identified but
not yet fixed — see `csim/python_3/utils.py`'s module docstring.

**Coverage:** this grammar does not parse positional-only parameters (`/`,
PEP 570), the walrus operator (`:=`, PEP 572), or `match`/`case` (PEP 634).
`csim/native/loader.py` falls back to `python_3_13` automatically for files
using those constructs, so results stay correct, just slower for that subset
(measured: ~4.2% of a large real corpus).

---

### Experimental: Java 24 native parser (grammars-v4/java/java)

Added a native C++ parser for Java using the optimized Java 24 grammar from
grammars-v4, available alongside the existing `java_20` parser (nothing about
`java_20` was removed or changed).

**Performance** (`csim group` end-to-end, 50 real files):

| Configuration | Time |
|----------------|------|
| Pure Python | 68.93s |
| Native `java_20` | 10.93s avg |
| Native `java_24` | 0.38s avg |

`java_24` is **~29x faster** than native `java_20`, and **~181x faster** than
pure Python, on this corpus.

**Known limitation — grouping correctness:** `csim/java_24/utils.py`'s
rule-normalization tables are a partial port of `java_20`'s, extended with a
`relabel_node()` engine hook (isolating assignment expressions from
`java_24`'s unified `expression` rule) that fixed *recall* -- known
near-duplicate pairs now correctly score 0.94-1.0 (were 0.5, undetected)
across all 38 verified true-positive pairs in a 50-file corpus. *Precision*
remains unfixed: on the same corpus, 532 of 570 pairs scoring above the 0.8
threshold are false positives (unrelated files sharing enough boilerplate to
look similar), because the shared-boilerplate-heavy submissions used to
verify this haven't had the broader rule-table tuning `java_20` has (~65
tuned exclusion entries, built via a dedicated corpus-tuner sweep referenced
in `java_20/utils.py`'s comments). **Do not use `java_24` for `group`/`report`
until this is fixed.**

**Usage**:
- `java_20` (existing, unchanged): use for `group`/`report` — correctness verified
- `java_24` (new, experimental): parsing/raw-tree correctness verified; grouping
  precision (false-positive rate) pending further rule-table tuning
- `python_3` (new): both parsing speed and grouping correctness verified — see above
- `csim info` reports native parser availability for all four languages
- `CSIM_DISABLE_NATIVE=1` forces pure-Python parsers for all

## [3.1.1]

Packaging fix. No changes to csim itself.

The 3.1.0 macOS wheel went out tagged `universal2`, claiming support for both
Intel and Apple Silicon, while carrying arm64-only libraries. On an Intel Mac
pip would install it, the libraries would fail to load, and csim would fall
back to the Python parser: correct results, no speedup. The wheel is now
tagged `arm64`, and the build checks each library's architecture against the
tag before packaging.

Linux and Apple Silicon users are unaffected by the bug and by the fix.

---

## [3.1.0]

Native C++ parsers for Java and C++, giving a **6-8x speedup** on `csim group`
and `csim report`. Results are unchanged: same trees, same similarity scores,
same output.

### Why

Profiling `csim group` showed parsing accounted for 96-100% of total runtime,
almost all of it inside `adaptivePredict`/`execATN` in the Python ANTLR runtime.
Tree edit distance and normalization were negligible next to it. Parsing now
runs through ANTLR's C++ runtime, which is what that bottleneck required.

### Performance

Measured on real judge submissions (50 Java files, 49 C++ files):

| Language | Before | After | Speedup |
|----------|--------|-------|---------|
| `java_20` | 68.75s | 11.41s | 6.0x |
| `cpp_14`  | 21.83s |  2.85s | 7.7x |

Those are cold-start numbers, what a CLI run pays. A long-running process
(a web service, for example) reuses the parser's prediction cache and sees
**7.4x** for Java and **7.8x** for C++ after the first request.

Stage breakdown in steady state:

| Stage | Java before | Java after | C++ before | C++ after |
|-------|-------------|------------|------------|-----------|
| parsing | 18.77s | 2.55s | 16.85s | 1.69s |
| normalize + prune | 0.01s | 0.01s | 0.03s | 0.02s |
| tree edit distance | 0.01s | 0.02s | 0.47s | 0.47s |

Parsing is the only stage that changed, which is what the profiling predicted.

### Correctness

The native and Python parsers were compared at every stage of the pipeline:
raw parse tree, `Normalize`, `PruneAndHash`, similarity score (both `zss` and
`apted`), and the final `group`/`report` output. Output is identical.

This was also verified file by file against 99 real judge submissions,
including ones containing syntax errors: every tree matched.

### Added

- **`csim info`** — reports which parser backend is active per language.
  When a compiled parser is missing or fails to load, csim falls back to the
  Python parser silently: results stay correct but run several times slower.
  This command makes that state visible.

  ```
  $ csim info
  csim parser backends

    python_3_13    python   (no native parser for this grammar)
    java_20        native   (C++, several times faster)
    cpp_14         native   (C++, several times faster)
  ```

- **`CSIM_DISABLE_NATIVE=1`** — forces the pure-Python parsers, for debugging
  or benchmarking.

- **`scripts/build_native_parsers.sh`** — builds the native parsers from the
  grammars. Requires the ANTLR generator, the ANTLR C++ runtime, and a C++17
  compiler.

### Notes

**Python is unchanged.** `python_3_13` keeps using the Python parser. The
modern Python grammar csim uses publishes no C++ target upstream, and the
legacy `python3` grammar that does parses *slower* than the Python runtime
(78ms vs 20ms on the same input). Python was also the cheapest language to
begin with — Java and C++ were where the time went.

**Nothing breaks without the native libraries.** If no compiled parser is
present for the platform, csim uses the Python parsers and behaves exactly as
before. Install from a platform wheel to get the speedup; `csim info` confirms
which path is active.

### Packaging

- Wheels are now platform-specific (`py3-none-<platform>`). The parsers are
  loaded through `ctypes` and use no CPython API, so one wheel per platform is
  correct and works on any Python 3.
- The source distribution carries the grammars and build scripts needed to
  rebuild the parsers, and no binaries.
- GitHub Actions builds and publishes wheels for manylinux and macOS.

### Internals

For anyone building on this:

- The C++ side emits the parse tree as a flat preorder `int32` buffer. JSON was
  tried first and turned out to cost ~90x the parse itself, erasing the gain.
- The rebuilt nodes expose the interface the existing visitors already use, so
  `Normalize`, `PruneAndHash` and the tree edit distance run unchanged.
- The ANTLR C++ runtime is linked statically, so the shipped libraries depend
  only on base system libraries.
- The `.g4` grammars remain a single source of truth for both targets;
  `scripts/transform_grammar_for_cpp.py` adapts them to C++ at build time.

## [3.0.0] — 2026-08-10

Explicit language versions, and normalization good enough to see through
common rewrites.

### Changed

- **Language identifiers now carry a version**: `python` → `python_3_13`,
  `java` → `java_20`, `cpp` → `cpp_14`. This is the breaking change: any call
  passing the old identifiers has to be updated. Pinning the version makes it
  clear which grammar a result came from, and leaves room for other versions
  later.
- **`apted` is now the default tree edit distance algorithm**, replacing `zss`.
  `zss` is still available via `--talg zss`.

### Added

- **`csim tree` / `csim view`** — prints the normalized and pruned tree for a
  single file: the exact tree the comparison actually runs on. `--show-raw`
  also prints the raw ANTLR parse tree, which is what you want when a
  similarity score looks wrong and you need to see why.
- **Assignment operator normalization** — `x += 1` and `x = x + 1` now compare
  as equivalent, so rewriting compound assignments no longer hides a copy.
- Per-language exclusion and hashing rules for all three languages, tuning
  which tokens and rules carry weight in the comparison.

### Fixed

- C++14 parser predicates used `this.` (valid for other ANTLR targets) instead
  of `self.`, which broke on the Python target.

---

## [2.0.0] — 2026-07-11

Multi-language support. csim went from a Python-only tool to handling three
languages.

### Added

- **Java 20 and C++14 support**, alongside Python. Grammars, generated
  parsers, and per-language normalization rules for each.
- **Test suite** — CLI and module tests, plus sample files per language.
- **Continuous integration** via GitHub Actions.
- `GETTING_STARTED.md` and strategy documentation.

### Changed

- Restructured into modules: `csim/language/` for parsing, `csim/processing/`
  for tree processing and distance metrics, and one package per language. The
  language-agnostic pipeline dates from here.

## 1.x — 2025-12-24 to 2026-03-11

The Python-only line, where the core comparison method took shape. First
release was **1.1.0**; there was no 1.0.0.

Notable steps:

- **1.1.0** — initial release: parse trees and tree edit distance over Python
  source.
- **1.3.0** — structural hashing to collapse equivalent subtrees.
- **1.4.0 / 1.4.1** — `PruneAndHash`: pruning the tree before comparison,
  which is what made larger files practical.
- **1.5.2** — control-flow equivalence, so a `for` and an equivalent `while`
  no longer count as unrelated.
- **1.6.0** — file grouping, built on Union-Find, together with the
  `--threshold` option. Before this, csim only reported pairwise similarity.
- **1.7.0** — APTED as an alternative tree edit distance algorithm.

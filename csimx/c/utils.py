# First integration pass (2026-08-20) for grammars-v4/c. Like Kotlin (see
# csimx/kotlin/utils.py), this grammar has NO ANTLR labeled alternatives
# anywhere (verified: zero `#Label` occurrences in CParser.g4), so no
# relabel_node()/synthetic-id machinery is needed -- every rule already has a
# unique rule index. get_relabel_fn() in csimx/utils.py has no "c" branch and
# returns None, which is correct, not an oversight.
#
# Like Kotlin (and unlike python_3's monolithic `expr`), C's expression
# grammar is already split one rule per ISO-C precedence level
# (multiplicativeExpression -> additiveExpression -> ... ->
# assignmentExpression). tree_processing.py's visitChildren already compresses
# any single-child hop through this chain.
#
# Tuning data: jv-umsa-dataset/all_c (real judge submissions). The tables were
# measured against the unpruned tree on two disjoint problem sets, see
# docs/pruning_fidelity.md (hashing policy: expression/declaration "islands"
# only, never the control-flow skeleton).
#
# IMPORTANT CAVEAT: this grammar's lexer/parser base classes
# (CLexerBase/CParserBase, vendored into this same package) default to
# `--nopp` (no real preprocessing) for reasons documented in
# grammars/CLexerBase.h -- `#include`/`#define`/etc. lines are swallowed as
# hidden tokens, unexpanded, rather than resolved. This means macro-dependent
# code (token-pasting tricks, macros used for control flow) can genuinely
# fail to parse or parse differently than a real compiler would see it -- see
# the C spike writeup in project memory for the concrete failure cases found
# against grammars-v4's own c-testsuite. Real judge submissions essentially
# never rely on those tricks, but it's a real, known limitation, not
# something these rule tables can paper over.

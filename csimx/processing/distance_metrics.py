    Normalizes the tree edit distance to a value between 0 and 1, where

    With `m = max(T1, T2)` and `s = T1 + T2`, the available formulas are:

    * ``ratio``: ``m / (m + d)``. Ranks pairs exactly as ``legacy``
      does -- it is a monotone rescaling of it, so the ROC/AUC of the two is
      identical -- but stays in (0, 1] by construction and needs no fallback
      branch. A fixed cut translates as ``t_ratio = 1 / (2 - t_legacy)``:
      legacy 0.70 == ratio 0.769, legacy 0.80 == ratio 0.833.
    * ``metric``: ``(s - d) / (s + d)``, the metric normalization of tree edit
      distance (Li & Zhang, Front. Comput. Sci. 2011). Satisfies the triangle
      inequality when all insert/delete costs share one weight. Ranks
      differently from ``ratio``: it normalizes by the total size of both
      trees, not by the larger one.
    * ``legacy`` (default): ``1 - d / m``, the index of csim <= 3.4.2 (and
      of 4.0.1 onwards). ``m`` does not actually bound ``d``, so this formula
      switches denominator to ``s`` above the bound, which makes its scale

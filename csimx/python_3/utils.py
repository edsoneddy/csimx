    index alone.

    All cases below follow the same shape: a labeled ANTLR alternative
    shares its parent's rule index with unrelated alternatives (see
    grammars/Python3Parser.g4), so EXCLUDED_RULE_TYPES/COLLAPSED_RULE_INDICES/
    HASHED_RULE_INDICES can't target just one alternative, or distinguish it
    from its siblings during comparison, without this hook -- mirrors
    java_24's relabel_node() for the same underlying reason.

    Import-shaped `small_stmt` (#import_stmt: IMPORT dotted_as_names,
    #from_stmt: FROM ... IMPORT ...): routed to COLLAPSED_RULE_INDICES,
    matching python_3_13's content-free import machinery. Fixed 15 of 2211
    threshold-crossing pairs on jv_dataset/all_py/1050 (67 files) -- see
    COLLAPSED_RULE_INDICES's comment for the full writeup.

    compound_stmt's SIX labeled alternatives (#if_stmt, #while_stmt,
    #for_stmt, #with_stmt, #try_stmt, #class_or_func_def_stmt) all share
    RULE_compound_stmt, so each gets its own synthetic id here. Without it a
    `for` vs `while` swap would look like the same construct.
    None of the compound alternatives is hashed or excluded any more (see
    HASHED_RULE_INDICES): the synthetic ids only keep each construct's
    identity distinct, so a `for` vs a `while` still costs a full mismatch
    while their bodies stay as real, comparable subtrees. try/except is kept
    for the same reason (measured: keeping it lowers the error vs. the
    unpruned tree on both the tuning and validation problem sets).

# Tuned 2026-08-12 for the grammars-v4/python/python "universal Python 2/3"
# grammar -- a separate, additional language from python_3_13 (which keeps
# its own grammar and utils.py untouched). This grammar's rule set is much
# flatter than python_3_13's (59 rules vs. python_3_13's much larger
# PEG-derived grammar) and shares no rule/token naming with it, so nothing
# here is ported 1:1 from python_3_13/utils.py -- only the general category
# of what's safe to treat as noise carries over, verified independently
# against real corpora (jv_dataset/all_py).
#
# Informed by lessons from tuning csimx/java_24: the grammar's root rule
# (file_input) is NOT in HASHED_RULE_INDICES -- hashing a root/body-wrapping
# rule collapses an entire file/branch to one opaque digest per
# hashing_tree's short-circuit-on-first-match behavior (see
# tree_processing.py), which either produces a degenerate always-1-node tree
# (if done at the true root) or can make several DIFFERENT files converge to
# identical trees once combined with enough other exclusions -- both were
# measured as real failures during java_24's tuning (see
# csim_native_parsers project memory).
#
# Status: pruning fidelity is measured against the unpruned tree, not against
# python_3_13's output. On 2 disjoint sets of 12 jv-umsa-dataset/all_py
# problems (1440 pairs each), the similarity index of the pruned trees differs
# from the unpruned one by a mean of ~0.09 (vs. ~0.15 before compound
# statements stopped being hashed) at ~5x node compression -- see
# docs/pruning_fidelity.md for method and numbers.

# node counts of 31-123 vs. python_3_13's 1-4), which made `csimx group`'s
